# Hello World :wave: :earth_americas:
##This is a basic repository GitHub wanted me to make so I did. :v:

A little about me...

I'm a web developer. I code primarily in PHP7, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and do some MySQL. I already coded a discontinued project named [n3u Niche Store](//github.com/Strykerraven/n3u-Niche-Store) that made use of GIT prior to creating this [hello-world](/) repository so I already knew how to use GIT but I was bored and GitHub wanted me to so here it is. Speaking of [n3u Niche Store](//github.com/Strykerraven/n3u-Niche-Store); I'm a strong supporter of F.O.S.S. **(Free Open Source Software)** and eventhough has been discontinued, I'll keep the code available for users to fork, study, and learn from. One interesting feature of worth pointing out is that it generates everything on the fly quickly without the need of a SQL database using. It also shows how to use an API to pull product data and even supports a uniquely coded by yours truely caching system that makes use of PHP headers to set caching options for the users web browser. It was put to the test under Google PageSpeed **(Now called [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/))** when that was first released so it has many performance techniques integrated. It also validates as valid HTML5 and CSS3.

Enough Rambling...

Goodbye World!
