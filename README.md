# hello-world
This is a basic repository GitHub wanted me to make so I did.

A little about me...
I'm a web developer. I code primarily in PHP5, CSS3, jQuery, and do some MySQL. I coded n3u Niche Store prior to creating this hello-world repo so I already know how to use GIT. I'm a strong supporter of FOSS (Free Open Source Software) and eventhough n3u Niche Store has been discontinued, I keep the code available for users to fork, study and learn from. One interesting feature of n3u Niche Story worth noting is that it generates everything on the fly fast without the need of a SQL database and doesn't forget a users configuration. It also shows how to use an API to pull product data and even supports a uniquely coded by yours truely caching system that even makes use of PHP headers. It was scrutized under Google PageSpeed when that was first released so it has many performance techniques. It also validates as HTML5 and CSS3. The code that makes up n3u Niche Store is all by hand and done using NetBeans IDE at the time. There are many things you can learn from studying its code and as web technologies have improved; It even has areas that can be improved. While I no longer wish to maintain the project, I encourage anyone that is interested to fork it.
